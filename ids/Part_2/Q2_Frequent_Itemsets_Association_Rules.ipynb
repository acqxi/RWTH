    "# Introduction into Data Science - Assignment Part II\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second part of the assignment in IDS 2023/2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the assignment consists of five questions â€” each of these questions is contained in a separate Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "- [Question 1: Data Preprocessing](Q1_Preprocessing_Visualization.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 2: Association Rules](Q2_Frequent_Itemsets_Association_Rules.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 3: Process Mining](Q3_Process_Mining.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 4: Text Mining](Q4_Text_Mining.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 5: Big Data](Q5_Big_Data.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional required files are in two folders.\n",
    "- [datasets](datasets/)\n",
    "- [scripts](scripts/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use the provided notebook to work on the questions. When you are done, upload your version of each of the notebooks to Moodle. Your submission will, therefore, consist of five jupyter notebook and _no_ additional file. Any additionally provided files will not be considered in grading.\n",
    "Enter your commented Python code and answers in the corresponding cells. Make sure to answer all questions in a clear and explicit manner and discuss your outputs. _Please do not change the general structure of this notebook_. You can, however, add additional markdown or code cells if necessary. Please **DO NOT CLEAR THE OUTPUT** of the notebook you are submitting! Additionally, please ensure that the code in the notebook runs if placed in the same folder as all of the provided files, delivering the same outputs as the ones you submit in the notebook. This includes being runnable in the bundled conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please make sure to include the names and matriculation numbers of all group members in the provided slots in each of the notebooks.* If a name or a student id is missing, the student will not receive any points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 1: **Plan your time wisely.** A few parts of this assignment may take some time to run. It might be necessary to consider time management when you plan your group work. Also, do not attempt to upload your assignment at the last minute before the deadline. This often does not work, and you will miss the deadline. Late submissions will not be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 2: RWTHMoodle allows multiple submissions, with every new submission overwriting the previous one. **Partial submissions are possible and encouraged.** This might be helpful in case of technical issues with RWTHMoodle, which may occur close to the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 3: As a technical note. Some IDEs such as DataSpell may automatically strip jupyter notebook cell metadata. If you are able, please re-add it from the source notebooks before submission. This is necessary for our grading."

    "Apriori Algorithm:\n",
    "Making Lists: Apriori starts by making lists of items bought together and keeps checking these lists against all shopping data to find matches. It begins with individual items and adds more to the list step by step, removing any list that doesn't pop up often enough in the shopping data.\n",
    "Step-by-Step Checking: It checks the data in steps, where each step looks at lists of different lengths. Apriori uses information from shorter lists (found in earlier steps) to decide which longer lists might also be popular, cutting down on the number of lists it needs to check but still requiring it to go through the shopping data many times.\n",
    "Slower with Big Data: Because of its method of checking and rechecking lists against all the data, Apriori can be slow and not as good for very large datasets. It has to read through all the shopping data multiple times, which takes a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "FP-Growth Algorithm:\n",
    "Building a Tree: FP-Growth takes a different approach by building a tree that shows which items are bought together. This tree is made by going through the shopping data twice: once to see which items are most common and again to build the tree using this information.\n",
    "Growing Patterns: Instead of making lists like Apriori, FP-Growth uses the tree to find patterns. It breaks the tree into smaller parts and finds popular combinations in each part by adding items to patterns it has already found. This way, it doesn't have to go through the whole shopping data again and again.\n",
    "Faster and More Scalable: FP-Growth is usually faster and better for handling big datasets because it doesn't need to make and check long lists of items. However, building and storing the tree can use a lot of computer memory, but this is often worth it because it makes the whole process much quicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting It Simply:\n",
    "How They Work: Apriori makes and checks lists of items, while FP-Growth builds a tree to simplify finding item combinations.\n",
    "Speed and Size: FP-Growth generally works faster, especially with a lot of data, because it doesnâ€™t go through the data as many times as Apriori does.\n",
    "Memory Use: FP-Growth might use more memory because of the tree, but it's usually worth it for its speed.\n",
    "Both methods aim to find out which items are often bought together, but FP-Growth often comes out ahead in terms of speed and handling bigger datasets, even though it might need a bit more memory to do its job."
